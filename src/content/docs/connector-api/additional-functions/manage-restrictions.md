# Manage restrictions

Restrictions in Mews are configured as combinations of [conditions and exceptions](https://help.mews.com/s/article/how-do-restrictions-work?language=en_US). Below are the three [restriction types](../operations/restrictions.md#restriction-type) that can be applied:

- Start: Closed to arrival, meaning guests cannot check-in within the specified dates.
- End: Closed to departure, meaning guests cannot check-out within the specified dates.
- Stay: Closed to stay, meaning guests cannot stay overnight within the specified dates.

Using the Connector API, restrictions are managed by [retrieving the existing restrictions](../operations/restrictions.md#get-all-restrictions), [adding a new restriction](../operations/restrictions.md#add-restrictions) or [deleting an existing one](../operations/restrictions.md#delete-restrictions).
A restriction can be applied to either rates or resources of a specified reservable service. A list of all services configured at a property is requested using [Get all services](../operations/services.md#get-all-services) and the services to which restrictions can be applied will have the [service type](../operations/services.md#service-type) `Reservable`.

### Adding a rate restriction

Properties can [configure their Mews rates](https://help.mews.com/s/article/create-a-rate?language=en_US) as individual ones, derived from another rate, as well as a part of a rate group. Integration partners use [Get all rates](../operations/rates.md#get-all-rates) to retrieve the rates configured at the property and the unique identifiers required for applying restrictions. To request information about rate groups, include the relevant [rate extent](../operations/rates.md#rate-extent).

Rate restrictions can be applied to the following:

- Exact rate - Specify `ExactRateId` to apply the restriction only to this exact rate.
- Base rate - Specify `BaseRateId` to apply the restriction to the base rate AND all its derived rates.
- Rate group - Specify `RateGroupId` to apply the restriction to all base and derived rates included in a rate group.

### Adding a resource restriction

Property resources refer to all of the active spaces available at a property and the initial configuration is done at the creation of the property profile in Mews.
Each individual resource is mapped to a resource category in order to define its intended purpose and availability.
Integration partners use [Get all resources](../operations/resources.md#get-all-resources) to retrieve the list of all resources at a given property. To request all related information, include the desired [resources extent](../operations/resources.md#resource-extent).

Resource restrictions can be applied to the following:

- Resource category - Specify `ResourceCategoryId` to apply a restriction to all spaces belonging to a specific category.
- Resource category type - Specify [resource category type](../operations/resources.md#resource-category-type) to apply a restriction to one type of resource.

Once created in Mews, rates are automatically applied to all active resource categories in their relevant service. In order to allow restrictions to be applied to only one specific resource category via the API, the integration partner needs to have the entire configuration of the property mapped out in their system. Repeatedly retrieving all resource information for all instances of the above is not optimal API usage.

Aside from the above, restriction conditions include specifying the time period to which it is applied as well as whether the restriction should apply to specific days.
If `EndUtc` is not specified when setting the time frame, the restriction will apply until deleted. Specifying one or more [days](../operations/restrictions.md#day) means that the restriction will apply only to that specific day of the week within the set time frame.

Once the [restriction conditions](../operations/restrictions.md#restriction-conditions) above have been determined, a restriction can be further specified using [restriction exceptions](../operations/restrictions.md#restriction-exceptions). Exceptions are used to managed the following:

- Availability before reservation start: Use `MinAdvance` and `MaxAdvance` when setting the minimum and/or maximum time prior to start of reservation at which the given rate or resource is to be available.
- Lenght of reservation: Use `MinLength` and `MaxLength` when setting setting the minimum and/or maximum length for which a reservation can be created within the specified time frame.
- Price of reservation: Use `MinPrice` and `MaxPrice` when setting the minimum and/or maximum price for which a reservation can be made within a specified time frame.

Ensuring that restrictions are correctly applied via the API requires clear communication between the integration partner and each individual property.
The number of restrictions and the conditions related to Start & EndUtc will depend on how the property manages their restrictions. As restrictions can be added in batches (as an array of conditions), the property can configure a week or two or month(s) in advance.

If the property will continue managing restrictions both via the integration and in Mews, integration partners can use the `ExternalIdentifier` when creating and retrieving restrictions to single out the ones made specifically via this integration.

As restrictions cannot be modified, only added or deleted, partners map existing restrictions and their identifiers in their system so that its available to be able to delete a restriction prior to its expiration.
