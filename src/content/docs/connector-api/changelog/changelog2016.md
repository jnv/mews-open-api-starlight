## 1st September 2016

* Added operation `Update Rate Base Price` that allows e.g. revenue management systems to provide recommended rates to MEWS.
* Added operation `Get All Reservation Items` that returns revenue items of selected reservations.
* Added `Currency` parameter to operations `Get Customers Open Items` and `Get All Accounting Items`.
* Deprecated operation `Get Customer Balance`. Operation `Get Customer Open Items` should be used instead, since it provides more complete information.
* Deprecated properties `Customer` and `Companions` on `Reservation`. `CustomerId` an `CompanionIds` should be used instead. The customer data are part of the result of `Get All Reservations`. This removes redundancy in the response data, especially in hostels where the customer is mostly the only companion and currently the customer data were twice in the result.
* We plan to make `Address` on `Customer` optional in order to reduce response sizes, in many cases the customers do not have address details filled in.
