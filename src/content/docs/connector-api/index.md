Welcome to the **Mews Connector API**! This is a general-purpose API that enables partners of Mews to access data and services in **Mews Operations**.

To make a quick start and get a feel for the API, see [Getting started](getting-started/). For a full guide on how to connect, what authentication tokens you need, the meaning of error codes and much more, see our [Usage guidelines](guidelines/). To gain deeper insights into Mews concepts, see [Concepts](concepts/). For guidance on using the API for specific scenarios, our [Use cases](use-cases/) section will help you through your implementation. Detailed information on all API operations can be found in [API Operations](operations/), and information on event mechanisms like Webhooks in [API Events](events/).
