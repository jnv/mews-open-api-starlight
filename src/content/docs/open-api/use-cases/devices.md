title: "Working with Devices"
---


We use the term _Devices_ to describe physical on-premise devices which we integrate into our cloud-native system, this includes key cutters or key encoders and also printers for printing hard-copy of guest bills.
Integration with such Devices is described in the [Device integrations use case](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/connector-api/use-cases/device-integrations) in the [Mews Connector API](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/connector-api).
